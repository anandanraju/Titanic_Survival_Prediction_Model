# Titanic_Survival_Prediction_Model
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in world history. In this model, need to analyse what sorts of people were likely to survive. We also need to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived in this tragedy.
